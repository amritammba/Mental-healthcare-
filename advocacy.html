<center><h1><b>MHALA PUBLIC POLICY AND ADVOCACY PLATFORM</b></h1><br></center>
    <p><i><b>Mental Health America of Los Angeles (MHALA) was born out of the advocacy of “mental health consumers” (i.e., people who access mental health services, who we refer to as “members” today). There have been several waves of advocacy by those who were diagnosed with and treated for mental illnesses, often in inhumane conditions. MHALA has a long history of advocating for mental health resources, access, and equity.

        MHALA has transformed how mental health is understood and addressed in California and across the United States through our innovative model of member support, training, and advocacy for laws, including California’s Mental Health Services Act. We continue to evolve in our approach and our advocacy evolves alongside it.</p></i></b>
