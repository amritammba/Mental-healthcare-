<p><i>Mindspring provides free mental health education opportunities to the public through webinars on a wide variety of mental health topics. Webinars are offered for free each week with the generous support of Polk County, Polk County BHDS, and United Way of Central Iowa.

All webinars are free and open to the public. Webinars are recorded and emailed to all registrants. Certificates of attendance are administered to anyone who participates in the live webinar and completes the survey at the end. Unfortunately, we are unable to provide certificates for those who have watched the recording.

Please see below for upcoming webinars and use the link to register.</i></p>
